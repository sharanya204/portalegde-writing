Three of four of my limbs were wedged inside a narrow granite chute while my body hung outside: my left hand fisted nervously in a crack just a little too big for comfort, both my ankles twisted fast between the chimney walls. I groped around my harness with my right hand, selecting and discarding chunky spring loaded aluminum devices ("cams") to wedge into the abyss, and found I had none whose width would match that of the crack where I hung.

I abandoned fruitless efforts and dangled there, held up by my extremities like some kind of partially dismembered spider. The sun beat down upon me.

** On the ground **

The day had begun as any other day at Camp 4 began: being woken up at the crack of dawn by a bus vomiting tourists at the Yosemite Falls parking lot. My partner and I split a breakfast bar, and forewent coffee: we were angling for an early start to beat the heat and the crowds. The occasion was the glorious culmination of a sparse three hours of instruction in the dark arts of placing trad climbing gear: my first time leading a trad climb. 

We picked one I'd followed once before, and while I had no recollection of gear placement beta, I was comfortable with the climbing. Because it's easy to feel comfortable with this climb, we were not the only ones setting up a yard sale at the base, but we were second in line when we got there. As we saddled up, and I attempted to sneak inside information on where the party ahead us was placing pro, my partner reminded me that if I'd rather be drinking coffee back at camp, bailing was perfectly alright. I demurred: I was pretty confident in my abilities, but it was hard not to be anxious my first time attempting any activity, let alone an activity as notorious as trad climbing.

I thought about our neighbors at camp, probably clinging to steel cables halfway up the snake slick hunchback of Half Dome and briefly envied them their day. I tried to remind myself that I'd climbed swan slab gulley before, that the climbing is so inconsequential to anyone familiar with the activity that it isn't any harder than a brisk walk.
