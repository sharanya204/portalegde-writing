Three of four of my limbs were wedged inside a narrow granite chute while my body hung outside: my left hand fisted nervously in a crack just a little too big for comfort, both my ankles twisted fast between the chimney walls. I groped around my harness with my right hand, selecting and discarding chunky spring loaded aluminum devices ("cams") to wedge into the abyss, and found I had none whose width would match that of the crack where I hung.

I abandoned fruitless efforts and dangled there, held up by my extremities like some kind of partially dismembered spider. The sun beat down upon me.

** On the ground **

The day had begun as any other day at Camp 4 began: being woken up at the crack of dawn by a bus vomiting tourists at the Yosemite Falls parking lot. My partner and I split a breakfast bar, and forewent coffee: we were angling for an early start to beat the heat and the crowds. The occasion was the glorious culmination of a sparse three hours of instruction in the dark arts of placing trad climbing gear: my first trad lead. 

I thought about our neighbors at camp, probably clinging to steel cables halfway up the snake slick hunchback of Half Dome and briefly envied them their day. I tried to remind myself that I'd climbed swan slab gulley before, that the climbing is so inconsequential to anyone familiar with the activity that it isn't any harder than a brisk walk.
